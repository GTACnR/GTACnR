# Chatbox Guide

Welcome to the comprehensive guide for using the chatbox effectively in the game. The chatbox is your gateway to communicating with other players, executing commands, and much more. Let's dive into the details.

## Accessing the Chatbox
- To **open** the chatbox, press `T`. This is your primary way to start chatting or entering commands.
- If you've **missed messages**, you can scroll through them by pressing `PAGE UP` and `PAGE DOWN` keys while the chatbox is active.

## Chatbox Commands Overview

Here's a quick reference table of commands you can use within the chatbox:
