# Understanding In-Game Colors

The game uses a color-coded system to easily identify the status and roles of players. Here's a breakdown of what each color represents:

- **WHITE**: Represents an Innocent Civilian, someone who's just going about their in-game life without any chaos.
- **ORANGE**: Indicates a Wanted Suspect. This player has committed crimes and is wanted by the law enforcement in-game.
- **RED**: Signifies a Most Wanted Suspect (Bounty). This player is not only wanted but has a bounty for their capture due to their crimes.
- **BLUE**: Designates a Law Enforcement Officer. These players are responsible for maintaining order and pursuing suspects.
- **PURPLE**: Identifies a Paramedic. These players are crucial for providing medical assistance to others.
- **GREEN**: Marks a Staff Member (Mod/Admin). These are the game moderators and administrators, overseeing the game's fairness and rules.
- **FLASHING WHITE**: Indicates a Suspect in Custody. This means the player has been apprehended by law enforcement.
- **FLASHING GRAY**: Denotes a Severely Wounded Player, someone who's in urgent need of medical attention.
