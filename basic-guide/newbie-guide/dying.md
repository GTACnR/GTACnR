# Dying

Death is an inevitable part of the game, but it's designed to be a minor setback rather than a game-ending event. Here's what you need to know about dying and the subsequent process:

*   **Revival Options**: When you die, you're faced with two choices. You can instantly revive yourself with the press of a button, sending you to the nearest hospital, or you can wait for a paramedic to come to your aid. Paramedics are automatically notified of your demise and will attempt to revive you.

* **Medical Bills**: Regardless of how you choose to be revived (hospital visit, ambulance healing, or paramedic revival), you will receive a bill for the medical services rendered. Should this bill exceed your character's current financial holdings, you'll find yourself in debt. Being in debt restricts your ability to summon cars or purchase items until the debt is cleared. Your debt, including any interest, will automatically be deducted from your account at noon in-game time.
*   **Exceptions to Paramedic Revival**: There are certain scenarios where the option to wait for a paramedic is unavailable. For example, deaths caused by extreme conditions such as a fiery explosion or a significant fall will automatically transport you to the nearest hospital.

While dying in-game is designed to be a recoverable event, it's important to manage your finances wisely to avoid the complications of in-game debt.

Remember, the game is structured to keep you in the action, even in death, so don't fear the inevitable. Learn, adapt, and enjoy the journey!
