# Dying

At some point, you're going to die. Don't worry about dying, as you have infinite lives. Upon death, you can revive at the touch of a button, which will take you to the nearest available Hospital, or wait for a paramedic (who will be automtically alerted of your misfortune) to come revive you.

You will be billed for whatever medical attention you recieve. Going to a hospital, getting healed by an Ambulance or being revived by a Paramedic. If the bill is higher than the amout of money you have on your character, you will go in debt causing you to be unable to call cars or buy items until you pay it back. Your debt along with interest will automatically be paid at noon in game time.

Note: Some deaths will not allow the option of a paramedic to revive you. Such as dying in a fiery explosion or falling from a great height. In this event, you will be ported to a nearby hospital immediately.
