# Jobs

As you start your journey on GTA:CnR, you will find players with different colors and jobs. As you level up, you gain access to different jobs which you can join by walking up to the job's NPC and switching to it. Jobs come with different uniforms, vehicles and weapons. To learn more about specific jobs, check out their Guides in the navigation bar.

## Criminal - _`Level 0+`_

When you start off your CnR journey, you will spawn as a civilian. As a civilian you can get a wanted level, rob stores, export and scrap vehicles, hunt bounties and more. This is the default job that most players use.

## Paramedic - _`Level 4+`_

As a paramedic your blip becomes purple and you get a seperate weapon and vehicle loadout from a criminal. Your job is to respond to calls and save lifes of players in danger. You can also heal people using your ambulance. Remember that as a Paramedic you cannot help Cops in their crime fighting duties and you must not pursue anyone.

## Drug Dealer - _`Level 5+`_

As a drug dealer you share the same loadout as in the criminal/mechanic job. You buy drugs at drug suppliers and then sell them at one of the Drug Spots marked on the map. Grove St. is a good place to sell heroin, while Mirror Park is a good place to sell cocaine. Discover your options and don't get caught, cops can confiscate your expensive drugs when they search you!
