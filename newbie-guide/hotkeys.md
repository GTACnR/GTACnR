Hotkeys serve as shortcuts to swiftly access items, commands, or weapons, bypassing the need to navigate through menus or type commands manually. They're crucial for enhancing your gameplay, whether you're looking to have fun or gain a tactical edge. Here's how to make the most out of hotkeys:

### Types of Hotkeys

- **Items**: Access items in your inventory instantly with a press of a button.
- **Commands**: Execute commands without typing them out, saving time and effort.
