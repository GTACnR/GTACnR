# Navigating the Online Player List

The online player list is an essential tool for seeing who's in the game, understanding their roles, and gauging their experience and connection quality. Here's how to access and navigate this list effectively:

## Accessing the List

- **Open the List**: Hold the `Z` key or press down on the d-pad. This action brings up the online player list.
- **Navigate the List**: While holding `Z`, use the `PG UP` and `PG DOWN` keys or the middle mouse scroll button to move through the list of players.

## Understanding List Details

The list provides a snapshot of vital information about each player:

- **Player ID**: Unique identifier for each player in the session.
- **Username**: The chosen name of the player.
- **Job**: The current role or job of the player. (Note: Criminals are listed as "None" under jobs.)
- **Total XP**: The accumulated experience points of the player.
- **Level**: The current level of the player, indicative of their progress in the game.
- **PING (Latency)**: A measure of the player's connection speed to the game server.
