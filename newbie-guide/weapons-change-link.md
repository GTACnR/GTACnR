# Acquiring and Managing Weapons

In the game, weapons are a crucial part of your arsenal, whether for self-defense, completing missions, or engaging in conflicts. Here's what you need to know about obtaining and managing your weapons:

## Obtaining Weapons

- **Location**: Weapons can be purchased at Gun Shops, which are marked by a gun icon on your map. A more limited selection is available at convenience stores and some gas stations.
- **Interaction**: To buy or browse weapons, press `E` when near a gun dealer.

## Weapon Collections and Role Switching

- **Shared Collections**: The roles of Criminal, Mechanic, and Drug Dealer have access to the same weapon collection, allowing for a seamless transition between these roles without losing access to your weapons.
- **Role-Specific Changes**: Switching to or from other roles may alter your weapon collection, as different roles have access to different sets of weapons.
